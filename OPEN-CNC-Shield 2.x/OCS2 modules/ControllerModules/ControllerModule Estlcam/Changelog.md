# ControllerModule Estlcam

## Changelog

### 1.04

- Removed arduino mega connection to mainboard 5V. So that the arduino will not give power to the mainboard.
- Estlcam V12 compability
  - Removed Motor stop and Programm stop inputs
- Added bigger sockel headers for a better fitting to the idc plugs of the mainboard

### 1.03

- changed position of the arduino mega a little, so that there is slightly more space between the usb cable and the mainboard driver power input
