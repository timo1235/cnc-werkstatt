# InOutModule Pluggable

## Changelog

### 1.05

- Replaced 1k 500mW resistors with 1k 1W resistors

### 1.04

- Added own resistors for all COM1 and GND lines to the slide switches
- Removed resistors arrays and added single resistors instead

### 1.03

- Changed input type switch connection from 5V to COM1. NPN sensors should now work as expected
- Added 1k resistor for all COM1 lines to the slide switches to prevent short circuit in case of broken slide switches
- Added 1k resistor for all GND lines to the slide switches to prevent short circuit in case of broken slide switches

### 1.02

- Correct labels for "-" and "+" of the inputs switches

### 1.0

- Initial pcb
